# Zoom Enterprise User Support Tool (Zoom ZEUS-Tool)

# Developer Comments
I will be working on updates to this sporadically throughout 2021 as other projects have my attention, with a couple needs-based updates with user groups and custom user tags/attributes and then I will be focusing on custom presets and bug fixes.   My code is not very object-oriented as well so some fine tuning of code to get it aligned with more modern and Pythonic practices will eventually come.

## January 29th, 2021 Update
- Finish first release of opening CSV files with previous metadata scans, since scans can take time, being able to open a previous scan can help reduce the acount of time needed to search for data

## January 27th, 2021 Update
- Fixes and improvements to last update along with a work in progress of opening CSV files of recording metadata.
## January 26th, 2021 Update
- Added ability to retrieve account cloud recording metadata and find cloud recordings if the user was a participant in the meeting.  This may take time to do if there are many cloud recordings on the account.  Directory creation isn't effective yet and button disabling will be needed based on sequence (scan metadata, find user in those meetings).

## November 24th, 2020 Update
- Allow custom attribute values to be set to group of users based on the filtering set in the Account actions page.  Minor update with Cloud storage readout to include overage amount on paid plans
- Updated Custom Attributes combo menu on Account Actions page to populate with values after triggering the Account Info button on the settings page. 
- Added account lock settings to be pulled and added into group settings file.  Also added timestamp to group settings file to be able to track changes over time.
- Working on custom API presets, still a work in progress so it is not fully functional nor does the gui have all the finalized features yet.


# Overview
Standalone Python program that manages deprovisoning or relicensing users in Zoom to basic based on either an email list of users, or their last sign-in date.  It uses the TKinter module to provide a very basic GUI interface.  A code-signed Windows App will be forthcoming, and I may also generate a Mac version once the code moves into a "beta" state.

Users need an API Key and API Secret with admin-level access from a JWT Token App in Zoom's marketplace.  The code will generate the JWT Token. 

The program will retrieve all users in account, check against the specified inactive data, and relicense users to Basic if they still have cloud recordings (if checked in the program) or else delete them if they also haven't been active for the specified number of months.  The program will save the user data to file, so it can be opened by the program again later.

As an option, the email list is just a list of email addresses of users with a header at the top of the csv file (i.e. Emails) that will be used to delete users from Zoom  en masse

Ultimately this is an interim tool for Zoom enterprise/business users that don't have a full user provisioning workflow in place and need to free up licenses.

# Basic Instructions
1. At a minimum you will need to populate the API Key and API Secret pulled from a Zoom JWT app
2. Select "Retrieve All Users" to initiate the building of a local file of all users in Zoom account associated with JWT Token (Excludes subaccounts currently)
3. Most other functionality in app requires step 2 to be completed.

Notes:  If processing of any function takes too long, you can select the "Cancel Action" button.  

# What big feature doesn't work yet
- Currently the LDAP feature is not yet functional, but some basic coding for LDAP connectivity and attribute retrieval does exist in the code.
- Custom API presets are not yet functional


# Bugs:
This is a functional alpha release and will license and delete users from your Zoom account.  There are bugs with re-opening the saved user file generated by the program, but that will be addressed soon.

-Backing up user settings can take a long time for large accounts (can be 7 hours).  At this time the program may freeze if between 1000-4000 user settings are backed up.   The CSV file will be generated, and if you want to continue backing up users from where it left off, you can enter the last email address listed in the CSV file under the "Restart Processing" frame.  The issue lies with the use of the TKinter GUI module and certain calls, so multi-threading will be introduced in the future to alleviate the issue.
-Will be addressing areas that list UTC time to display in local timezone.

# Considerations
The program will retrieve a single user in multiple Zoom groups, but at this time any other functionality that processes group information will only look at one group.

# Requirements
User can now have a lower resolution to comfortably view the entire program GUI.  Future updates are still being planned for the GUI.


# Files Generated by Program
The program will generate multiple files, based on your choice of actions in the same folder as the program:
- A log file of all the contents of the log window, if the log window is cleared, and new log file will be started
- User Setting Tracking.csv - backup of user settings (can be used to generate pivot tables to see how many users made certain setting changes)
- Zoom Group Setting Tracking.csv - backup of all the groups setting in the account
 -Zoom Retrieved User List.csv - backup of retrieve user data from Zoom, can be used as a basis to generate an update list that can be imported into the Zoom webportal
 
#Button Functionality
##Settings

### Required Info

#### Open Credentials file
(optional) Open a CSV file that contains the API Key, API Secret, Domain, LDAP Host LDAP Login, and LDAP Password.  This is not a recommended method since this is pulling data from a cleartext source.   May investigate alternatives in the future like LastPass integration.
#### Account Info
A quick way to test if the API Key and Secret are valid, should pull cloud storage and available license info and populate the status bar with the information.

#### API Key
API Key pulled from Zoom JWT app in Zoom Marketplace.  Will need account-level access (admin user typically or account owner)

#### API Secret
API Secret pulled from Zoom JWT app in Zoom Marketplace.  Will need account-level access (admin user typically or account owner)

#### Email Domain
(optional) Enter your organization's domain, and and entries that are clicked in the log window that contain the domain will automatically populate the User Email field

### Log Window

#### Log window
This is a list box that contains text of any action the program is performing on Zoom.  The contents will be automatically saved to a log file as it is updated (if that feature is enabled).  Selecting an item in the log window that contains the '@' symbol will populate the user email field below with that value.

#### Cancel Action
Will end any processing that is happening (i.e. retrieving all user Data, backing user settings,..) that may have long processing times.  Any data pulled to the point that the Cancel Action button was triggered will be saved or processed.

#### Clear Log

#### Search Textbox
Enter characters/words to search for in Log list.  Will highlight all matched entries

#### Find Next
Will navigate to the next matching item listed in the Search Textbox.

#### Log config
This will bring up another window with options for what should be displayed in the log window.
