# zoom-enterprise-user-deprovisioning

Standalone Python program that manages deprovisoning or relicensing users in Zoom to basic based on either an email list of users, or their last sign-in date.  It uses the TKinter module to provide a very basic GUI interface.

Users need an API Key and API Secret with admin-level access from a JWT Token App in Zoom's marketplace.  The code will generate the JWT Token. 

The program will retrieve all users in account, check against the specified inactive data, and relicense users to Basic if they still have cloud recordings (if checked in the program) or else delete them if they also haven't been active for the specified number of months.  The program will save the user data to file, so it can be opened by the program again later.

As an option, the email list is just a list of email addresses of users with a header at the top of the csv file (i.e. Emails) that will be used to delete users from Zoom  en masse

Ultimately this is an interim tool for Zoom enterprise/business users that don't have a full user provisioning workflow in place and need to free up licenses.

## Basic Instructions
1. At a minimum you will need to populate the API Key and API Secret pulled from a Zoom JWT app
2. Select "Retrieve All Users" to initiate the building of a local file of all users in Zoom account associated with JWT Token (Excludes subaccounts currently)
3. Most other functionality in app requires step 2 to be completed.

Notes:  If processing of any function takes too long, you can select the "Cancel Action" button.  

## What big feature doesn't work yet
Currently the LDAP feature is not yet functional, but some basic coding for LDAP connectivity and attribute retrieval does exist in the code.

## Bugs:
This is a functional alpha release and will license and delete users from your Zoom account.  There are bugs with re-opening the saved user file generated by the program, but that will be addressed soon.

## Considerations
The program will retrieve a single user in multiple Zoom groups, but at this time any other functionality that processes group information will only look at one group.

## GUI

## Requirements
User needs to have a minimum of a 1080P height resolution to comfortably view the entire program GUI.  Future updates are planned to change this to a much lower resolution.
